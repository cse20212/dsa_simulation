Sorting Simulator

How to Compile and Build









==============================
How to use our program

-There are two sets of radio buttons: Algorithms and Data
-The set of radio buttons under the header Algorithms represents the options of algorithms you can choose from to simulate
      Note: These include Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort
-The set of radio buttons under the header Data represents the different types of data sets you can choose to sort 
      Note: These include Inverse and Random
-In order to use the program, you must first select the sorting algorithm you want to use, as well as the data set you want to sort for the simulation
      Note: The default sorting algorithm is Insertion Sort and the default data set type is Inverse
-Once you have selected the algorithm and data set, you may use the simulation toolbar at the top left of the GUI window to run the simulation. The four buttons correspond to four different simulation actions:
      1. |<  The simulation will step back through the algorithm from its current position to the initial start of the   
             algorithm
      2.  <  The simulation will step back one step in the algorithm from its current position
      3.  >  The simulation will step forward one step in the algorithm from its current position
      4. >|  The simulation will step forward through the algorithm from its current position to the end of the algorithm
