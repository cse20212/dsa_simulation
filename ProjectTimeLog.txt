4:00-6:00 (2/22/15):
meeting


7:00-11:00pm(2/24/15):
Added slots and signals to insertionsort class
Added “Next” button that advances the algorithm one step and update graphics window
There is some bugs with dataset modification


9:00-11:00pm(2/25/15):
Trying to fix the Qlist modification bugs


7:00-9:00pm(3/3/15)
Read documentation on Github commands and branching
Read documentation on Qt Graphics window, widget and view


8:00-11:00pm(3/5/15)
Adjusted the graphics items size, placed them inside graphics window
Added pointer graphics to processed data, but the pointers are not displayed correctly


11:am - 12:00 pm (3/6/15)
Read documentation on Git merge, push, commit commands and Git workflow


7:00pm - 10:00pm (3/6/15)
Fixed the pointer problem and now the color change correctly indicates the data being processed




2:00pm - 7:00pm (3/17/15)
Modified the program structure so that two new classes, traceReader and traceWriter handles the algorithm data states


2:00pm - 7:00pm (3/19/15)
Worked on insertion sort with the traceReader and traceWriter. Program is now able to step forward and backward through a program


7:00pm - 9:00pm (3/24/15)
Started working on mergesort trace handling; thinking about how to represent data with recursive algorithm


7:00pm - 10:00pm (3/26/15)
Continue working on mergesort


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/5/15)
Added the functionality to continuously step through the algorithm


8:10am - 9:30am (4/6/15)
Fixed bugs with the timer used to step through the algorithm and layout problem


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/9/15)
Started working on generating random data sets


8:00pm - 9:30pm (4/11/15)
Managed to modify random data set programmatically at run time  


8:10am - 9:30am (4/13/15)
Modified mergesort for the new random data generation


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/15/15)
Fixed the bugs with modified random data set, so that mergesort displayed correctly


8:00am - 9:00am (4/17/15)
Added random number generator into the data set


7:00pm - 10:00pm (4/18/15)
Fixed the bugs in selection sort
