MaryKathryn Williams
2/22/15 4:00-6:00pm
Meeting

2/25/15 7:00-9:00pm
Watched Qt Tutorials (On Youtube by C++ Tutorial)

2/26/15 8:00-9:00pm
Looked at code Cindy wrote to understand what she created so far

3/5/15 8:00-9:00 pm
Watched Github tutorials and looked at Github documentation

3/11/15 2:00-4:00pm
Watched more Qt Tutorials (On YouTube by C++ Tutorial)

3/12/15 8:00-10:00pm
Worked on implementing selection sort algorithm; doesn't compile

3/18/15 9:00-10:00pm
Got selection sort algorithm to compile; created radio button for algorithm on gui; radio button not
yet linked to algorithm

3/20/15 3:00-3:30pm
Able to get radio button linked with algorithm; algorithm sorts data but steps are not in right order

3/23/15 7:00-8:00pm
Fixed some errors in selection sort algorithm; still compiles and sorts but steps are still not in
right order; simulation seems to be skipping step

3/27/15 10:00am-12:00pm
Read through Cindy's code (tracewriter and tracereader) to understand new process of simulation

3/29/15 12:00-1:30pm
Re-worked selection sort to fit new design process; compiles but doesn't work yet

4/2/15 8:00-10:00pm
Watched Qt Tutorials and read documentation on how to create a static text box for our psuedocode

4/7/15 2:00-3:30pm
Created a text box and wrote corresponding files to display particular psuedocode that corresponds to
the current algorithm

4/10/15 11:00am-1:30pm
Continued to work on selection sort






Xinyi Wang
4:00-6:00 (2/22/15):
meeting


7:00-11:00pm(2/24/15):
Added slots and signals to insertionsort class
Added “Next” button that advances the algorithm one step and update graphics window
There is some bugs with dataset modification


9:00-11:00pm(2/25/15):
Trying to fix the Qlist modification bugs


7:00-9:00pm(3/3/15)
Read documentation on Github commands and branching
Read documentation on Qt Graphics window, widget and view


8:00-11:00pm(3/5/15)
Adjusted the graphics items size, placed them inside graphics window
Added pointer graphics to processed data, but the pointers are not displayed correctly


11:am - 12:00 pm (3/6/15)
Read documentation on Git merge, push, commit commands and Git workflow


7:00pm - 10:00pm (3/6/15)
Fixed the pointer problem and now the color change correctly indicates the data being processed




2:00pm - 7:00pm (3/17/15)
Modified the program structure so that two new classes, traceReader and traceWriter handles the algorithm data states


2:00pm - 7:00pm (3/19/15)
Worked on insertion sort with the traceReader and traceWriter. Program is now able to step forward and backward through a program


7:00pm - 9:00pm (3/24/15)
Started working on mergesort trace handling; thinking about how to represent data with recursive algorithm


7:00pm - 10:00pm (3/26/15)
Continue working on mergesort


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/5/15)
Added the functionality to continuously step through the algorithm


8:10am - 9:30am (4/6/15)
Fixed bugs with the timer used to step through the algorithm and layout problem


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/9/15)
Started working on generating random data sets


8:00pm - 9:30pm (4/11/15)
Managed to modify random data set programmatically at run time  


8:10am - 9:30am (4/13/15)
Modified mergesort for the new random data generation


7:00pm - 9:00pm (4/15/15)
Fixed the bugs with modified random data set, so that mergesort displayed correctly


8:00am - 9:00am (4/17/15)
Added random number generator into the data set


7:00pm - 10:00pm (4/18/15)
Fixed the bugs in selection sort
